A twitter bot that befriends users based on given search terms. 

The idea is to run it on a regular basis, like everyday., in the mourning maybe. You would need a computer with access to the twitter api and some sort of job scheduler. Or I guess if you can figure how to send a message in a bottle or via western union to the twitter api. In which case please fork this and tell me how you do it.

`
Usage:

php update_twitter.php -s username -p password -s search_terms

I think this could have been useful a couple of years ago. Backward thinking?
